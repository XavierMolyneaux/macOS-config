## TODO

- [ ] Conform config files
    * Are the ones commented out in the setup file the only ones needed?
- [ ] Add a way to install apps/packages to a specific location
    * Specify versions as well
    * Specifically virtual envs.
- [ ] Add more dev tools to apps.txt
    * pip and npm installs 
- [ ] Ensure brew install works with all apps/packages
- [ ] Add more terminal and macOS settings 
- [ ] Error handling 
- [ ] Add shell aliases 
- [ ] Ensure Mac M1 compatibility
